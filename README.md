cmb2sphere
----------

Converts [Planck](http://sci.esa.int/planck/) temperature data into a height
profile on a sphere. Inspired by ['Cosmic sculpture: a new way to visualise the cosmic microwave background'] [1] by Clements, D. L., S. Sato, and A. Portela Fonseca.

I plan to write about how the process works, how to use the script and how to print the resulting file soon(tm). Feel free to remind me if this notice is still up.

Also forgive some bad stylistic choices, the certainly existing bugs and
anything that is wrong with the script. As often in "research" there wasn't
enough time to do it right... or maybe I was to lazy to improve it further. :p
(We really need a standardized note for this)

The script itself is usable under the GPLv3. Please see the *COPYING* file for

clear enough on the point, please consider the resulting mesh files under a CC0
